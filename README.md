 ### Frontend section
 
1st Step task: Code is simple as it possible, so you should be able to understand its basics concepts 2-3 days or even faster if you're already familiar with JS and HTML.

2nd: Let's mix a things a little bit! Add a new field called "Title" to app's sources at Todo creator inputs and Todo item view.
"Title" expected to work as previous field called "todo", only one thing I want you to do - is **create a copy of it and make it work**.

3rd: Now as we have a lot of todo's done we need to have a possibility to delete some of them, so as you understand - you should to 
**implement a deleting functionality** to your app

4th: Is it enough, only creating and deleting? No! We need to edit our mistakes here so **add a editing functionality** to this app.

5th: Now it is time to **add some state management**. Use Redux or MobX (Redux preffered) in your app.

6th: Let's make our app beautifull now! It's dangerous to go alone, take [this](https://material-ui.com/) or take [this](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)! Make your app looks like
something pretty [example](https://web.archive.org/web/20000510151720/http://www.yandex.ru:80/). (Animations on CSS and ShapeShifts will be +)

### Backend section

7th: Create nodejs server. Use express and start the backend.

8th: Create endpoints for existing functionality that frontend requires.

9th: Use some SQL database solution for storing records - **PostgreSQL** is preferable.

10th: For backend use Test Driven Development (TDD). Your code must be covered by tests at least 89%.

### Both

11th: Now our project is have to be published. Use "Heroku" and Node.js to **stage your app online**.

12th: **Add some user specific functions** like data saving and SignUp\Register functionality. Such function save to be implemented on server and client sides.

13th: Now you're free to do everything you want. If you have enough free time - **add some interesting things**, that you consider desirable. (Server Side Rendering for react or running your backend on http2 protocol for example)

**Extra tasks**: Addaptive design and UI, your own RESTfull API, SPA implementation, PWA implementation,
data syncronization with any of cloud services, Import\Export feauteres.
